## Introduction

Digital Image Processing involves the manipulation of images using computational algorithms to enhance, analyze, and extract information. This repository contains practical implementations of key concepts explored during the course.

## Assignments

### Histogram Equalization

**Objective:** Enhance the contrast of images by redistributing the intensity values.

**Description:** This assignment involves implementing histogram equalization to improve the visual quality of images, making features more distinguishable.

**Files:**
- `histogram_equalization/`

### My Lazy Scanner

**Objective:** Develop a simple document scanner that corrects perspective and enhances the readability of scanned documents.

**Description:** This project focuses on transforming images of documents taken at arbitrary angles into a top-down view, followed by enhancing the image for better clarity.

**Files:**
- `my_lazy_scanner/`

### Wiener Filter

**Objective:** Apply the Wiener filter to restore images degraded by noise.

**Description:** This assignment entails implementing the Wiener filter to perform image de-noising, aiming to recover the original image from a noisy observation.

**Files:**
- `wiener_filter/`
