#The function my_corner_harris can get Ridiculously SLOW! especially for larger images, so I have implemented the algorithm the way the excircise commanded 
#And I also implemented a method that is the default and it is named 'Fast' that uses a Gaussian filter directly to the Gradient Product Images Ixx Ixy and Iyy
#Essentially it performs the same Weighted summation over a neighborhood BUT it runs orders of Magnitude Faster. I left the other method that can be tried if you pass
